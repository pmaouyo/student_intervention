In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "Other columns, like `Mjob` and `Fjob`, have more than two values, and are known as _categorical variables_. The recommended way to handle such a column is to create as many columns as possible values (e.g. `Fjob_teacher`, `Fjob_other`, `Fjob_services`, etc.), and assign a `1` to one of them and `0` to all others.\n",

    "The logistic regression model is most appropriate because it has the highest average accuracy of the algorithms we tested, has very competitive training time (compared to the GaussianNB classifier, which trains fastest), and the quickest prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though I was personally predicting that the GaussianNB classifier would perform best due to the small size of the available dataset, it appears the logistic regression model has better accuracy. This may be due to a large number of features that may be correlated (which the GaussianNB classifier would be worse equipeed to handle).\n",
    "\n",
    "I will concede that, for purposes of scalability, GaussianNB is attractive because it takes less time to train (O(log n) as opposed to O(n) for logistic regression models), but there are plenty of ways that logistic regression models can be made more scalable. And, in any case, with more data logistic regression will perform better because Naive Bayes tends to be high bias/low variance and therefore won't be able to make as powerful predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, if all that is not enough, since logistic regression provides probabilities, you can identify which students are more vs. less likely to fail and can distribute resources to them accordingly (e.g. you may want to give really at-risk kids a LOT of additional support, and relatively less at-risk kids some, but not as much additional support)."

    "\n",
    "The final model uses logistic regression. It learns--or figures out patterns--by looking at a bunch of students for which it knows their outcome, either that they passed or failed. As it looks at these students, it looks at all the features about them (like how much they study, how much they go out, how much education their parents have, etc.) and figures out (1) how much that feature is correlated with whether or not they passed, and (2) in which direction it is correlated, e.g. positively or negatively. From doing all of that, the model can make generalizations about the features, and for each say something along the lines of: \"OK this feature is really important, and the higher it is, the more likely it is for a student to have passed\" (which would make sense for perhaps the mom's education level) or \"This feature is not as important, but when its high the student is more likely to have passed\" (perhaps relevant to involvement in extracurricular activities) or \"This feature is not important at all\" (perhaps relevant to students' ages). In making those generalizations about each feature, the model basically assign a positive or negative weight to each one, showing how much it 'pulls' students closer to or farther away from passing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model can then make predictions about students for whom it has feature info, but not pass/fail info. To make those predictions, the model takes the generalizations it's made about each feature, puts those generalizations against what each feature is like for a student (e.g. if the student's parents have had a lot of--or just a little--education) and then takes the sum of those weighted features to see if a student is more or less likely to have passed. That is, if for a lot of features that are strongly positively correalted with passing, the student scores high, all those features are 'pulling' the student toward passing. On the other hand, if for those same features, the stuent scores low, they are more likely to be pulled in the opposite direction, toward failig."
